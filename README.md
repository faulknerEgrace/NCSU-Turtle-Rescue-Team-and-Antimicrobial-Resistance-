# NCSU-Turtle-Rescue-Team-and-Antimicrobial-Resistance-

Antibiotic Resistance (AR) can be found beyond healthcare settings and presents a One Health challenge, impacting human, animal, and environmental health. Wildlife could serve as sentinels for AR in the environment. The bacterial flora of North Carolina (NC) wild turtles is not well-understood, and the presence and characteristics of resistant bacteria in this population have not been previously described. Rhea Lab conducted a pilot study to assess the feasibility of using admitted NC State University (NCSU) Turtle Rescue Team (TRT) native NC turtle patients as bioindicators of local AR in the environment.

Rhea Lab in collaboration with the North Carolina State University College of Veterinary Medicine Turtle Rescue Team (TRT) collected turtle demographic information and biological cloacal samples during TRT Intake and Discharge Procedures from admitted turtles from April 1,2023 to June 30, 2023 at NCSU CVM. The study consisted of rolling admissions of hospitalized turtle cases. Cloacal samples were processed with a focus on isolation of Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Salmonella, due to their presence in turtle GI flora and the environment, pathogenic potential in humans and animals, and demonstrated AR. 

The study goals were 1).Identify the presence of and characterize antimicrobial resistant bacteria among TRT turtles and 2). Assess the feasibility of using admitted TRT native NC turtle patients as bioindicators of local antimicrobial resistance in the environment. 

I created the survey instrument using EpiInfo for data collection of demographic and cloacaal sample testing information. Using these data, I described the initial cohort and AR data, which can be found in Rmarkdown, an ESRI Dashboard, and powerpoint.
